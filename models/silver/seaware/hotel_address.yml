- name: hotel_address
  description: 'The hotel_address model represents a standardized view of hotel address
    data from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems may differ
    due to variations in data collection, processing, or update frequencies.  This
    model is used downstream to provide a unified view of hotel address information
    for reporting, analytics, and auditability purposes.  Key analytical use cases
    include analyzing hotel address data by region, country, or city, and tracking
    changes to hotel addresses over time.
