  description: 'This model represents the standardized view of package selling usage
    across multiple systems,  providing a unified understanding of how packages are
    utilized. Data from different systems may  differ due to variations in data collection
    methods or system-specific nuances. This model is  used downstream for reporting,
    analytics, and auditability, offering insights into package  allocation, usage,
    and inventory management.
