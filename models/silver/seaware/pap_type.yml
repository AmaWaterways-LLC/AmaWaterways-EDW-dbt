  description: 'The pap_type model represents a standardized view of PAP (Product
    Application Process) types across multiple source systems, including SW1 and SW2.
    This model is crucial for downstream analytics and reporting, providing a unified
    understanding of PAP types and their characteristics. Data from multiple systems
    may differ due to variations in data entry, formatting, or system-specific nuances.
    This model is used to generate reports, track metrics, and ensure auditability
    across the enterprise.
