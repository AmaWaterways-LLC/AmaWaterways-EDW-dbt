      This model represents the standardized form of transactions across multiple systems, 
      providing a unified view of financial transactions. Data from different systems may 
      differ due to varying data formats and processing rules. This model is used 
      downstream for financial reporting, analytics, and auditability, enabling the 
      organization to track and analyze transactions consistently.
