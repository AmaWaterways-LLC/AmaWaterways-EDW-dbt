  description: 'The package_color model represents a standardized view of package
    color data from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems
    may differ due to variations in data entry, processing, or timing.  This model
    is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of package color information,
    facilitating reporting, analytics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases
    include tracking color usage, identifying trends, and monitoring data discrepancies
    between source systems.
