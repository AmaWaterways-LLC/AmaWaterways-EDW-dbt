  description: 'This model represents the standardized log header data from multiple
    insurance exchange systems,  providing a unified view for analytics and reporting.
    The data from different systems may differ  due to variations in data formatting
    and processing. This model is used downstream to analyze  exchange trends, track
    data quality, and ensure auditability. Key analytical use cases include  reporting
    on exchange volumes, monitoring data integrity, and identifying areas for process
    improvements.
