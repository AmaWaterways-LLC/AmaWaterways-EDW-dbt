  description: 'The sw_documents model represents standardized documents from multiple
    source systems,  including SW1 and SW2. Data from these systems may differ due
    to variations in data  collection and processing methods. This model is used downstream
    for reporting, metrics,  and auditability purposes, providing a unified view of
    documents across the enterprise.  Key analytical use cases include document categorization,
    entity type analysis, and  tracking changes to documents over time.
