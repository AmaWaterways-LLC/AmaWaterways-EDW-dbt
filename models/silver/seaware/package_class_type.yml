  - name: package_class_type
    description: >
      This model represents a standardized view of package class types across multiple source systems, 
      including SW1 and SW2. The data from these systems may differ due to variations in data entry, 
      processing, or timing. This model is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of package 
      class types, enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability. Key analytical use cases 
      include analyzing package class type distributions, tracking changes over time, and identifying 
      discrepancies between source systems.

    columns:
      - name: PACKAGE_CLASS_TYPE_SURROGATE_KEY
        description: >
          A unique identifier for each package class type, generated by combining the package class 
          type and data source. This column serves as the primary key for this model, ensuring each 
          row is uniquely identifiable.

      - name: DATA_SOURCE
        description: >
          The source system from which the package class type data originated, either SW1 or SW2. 
          This column is used to track the origin of each record and enable source-specific analysis.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: RECORD_ID
        description: >
          A unique identifier for each record within the source system. This column is used to track 
          changes to individual records over time.

      - name: PACKAGE_CLASS_TYPE
        description: >
          The type of package class, which is a critical attribute for analysis and reporting. This 
          column is used to categorize and summarize package class types across source systems.

      - name: COMMENTS
        description: >
          Additional comments or notes related to the package class type. This column provides 
          context and supplementary information for analysis and reporting.

      - name: LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP
        description: >
          The timestamp when the record was last updated in the source system. This column is used 
          to track changes to records over time and enable time-based analysis.

      - name: SOURCE_DELETED
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the record has been deleted in the source system. This column 
          is used to track record deletion and enable accurate analysis of record changes.
