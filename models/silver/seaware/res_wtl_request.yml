  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of work requests from multiple
    source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ due to variations
    in data entry, processing, or system-specific nuances.  This model is used downstream
    to provide a unified view of work requests, enabling key analytical use cases
    such as reporting, metrics calculation, and auditability.
