  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of alternate addresses from
    multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ
    due to varying update frequencies, data entry practices, or system-specific nuances.  This
    model is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of alternate addresses,
    facilitating reporting, analytics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases
    include tracking address changes, identifying data discrepancies between source
    systems, and analyzing address distributions.
