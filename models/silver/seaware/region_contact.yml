- name: region_contact
  description: 'The region_contact model represents standardized contact information
    for regions across multiple data sources.  Data from different systems may differ
    due to variations in data entry, formatting, or update frequencies.  This model
    is used downstream for reporting, analytics, and auditing purposes, providing
    a unified view of region contacts.  Key analytical use cases include tracking
    changes in contact information over time and analyzing regional contact trends.
