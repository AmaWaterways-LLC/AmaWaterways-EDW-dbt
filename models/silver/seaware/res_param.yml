  description: 'The res_param model represents a standardized view of resource parameters
    across multiple systems,  including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to consolidate
    and harmonize data from these systems,  enabling downstream analytics and reporting.
    The data from multiple systems may differ due to  variations in data formatting,
    encoding, or synchronization timing. This model provides a unified  view of resource
    parameters, facilitating key analytical use cases such as reporting, metrics,  and
    auditability.
