    description: >
      The package_class_code model represents a standardized view of package class codes across multiple source systems, including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to provide a unified understanding of package class codes, enabling accurate reporting and analytics. The data from multiple systems may differ due to variations in data entry, formatting, or system-specific nuances. This model is used downstream to support key analytical use cases, such as tracking package class code usage, identifying trends, and auditing data quality.

    columns:
      - name: PACKAGE_CLASS_CODE_SURROGATE_KEY
        description: >
          A unique surrogate key generated from the combination of PACKAGE_CLASS_CODE, PACKAGE_CLASS_TYPE, and DATA_SOURCE. This key ensures row uniqueness and facilitates efficient data retrieval.

      - name: DATA_SOURCE
        description: >
          The source system from which the package class code data originates, either SW1 or SW2. This column is used to track data provenance and identify potential discrepancies between source systems.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: RECORD_ID
        description: >
          A unique identifier for the package class code record within the source system. This column is used to track changes to individual records over time.

      - name: PACKAGE_CLASS_TYPE
        description: >
          The type of package class code, which provides additional context for the code's usage and application. This column is used to support reporting and analytics.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: PACKAGE_CLASS_CODE
        description: >
          The actual package class code, which is used to classify and track packages. This column is a key component of the surrogate key and is used to support reporting and analytics.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: COMMENTS
        description: >
          Additional comments or notes related to the package class code. This column provides supplementary information that may be useful for auditing or troubleshooting purposes.

      - name: LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP
        description: >
          The timestamp when the package class code record was last updated in the source system. This column is used to track changes to individual records over time.

      - name: SOURCE_DELETED
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the package class code record has been deleted in the source system. This column is used to track data provenance and identify potential discrepancies between source systems.
