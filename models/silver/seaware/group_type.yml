    description: >
      The group_type model represents a standardized view of group types across multiple systems, 
      including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to consolidate and harmonize data from these systems, 
      providing a single source of truth for analytics and reporting. The data from multiple systems 
      may differ due to variations in data formatting and collection methods. This model is used 
      downstream to support key analytical use cases, such as reporting on group type distributions 
      and analyzing the effectiveness of incentive programs.

      - name: GROUP_TYPE_SURROGATE_KEY
        description: >
          A unique surrogate key generated from the combination of GROUP_TYPE and DATA_SOURCE. 
          This key is used to uniquely identify each group type record.

      - name: DATA_SOURCE
        description: >
          The source system from which the group type data was extracted. This column is used to 
          track the origin of the data and support data quality analysis.

      - name: RECORD_ID
        description: >
          A unique identifier for the group type record within the source system. This column is 
          used to support data lineage and auditing.

      - name: GROUP_TYPE
        description: >
          The type of group, such as a sales team or marketing group. This column is used to 
          categorize and analyze group performance.

      - name: COMMENTS
        description: >
          Additional comments or notes about the group type. This column is used to capture 
          contextual information about the group.

      - name: IS_INCENTIVE
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the group type is eligible for incentives. This column is used 
          to support analysis of incentive program effectiveness.

      - name: LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP
        description: >
          The timestamp when the group type record was last updated in the source system. This 
          column is used to track data freshness and support incremental data loading.

      - name: SOURCE_DELETED
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the group type record has been deleted in the source system. 
          This column is used to support data lineage and auditing.
