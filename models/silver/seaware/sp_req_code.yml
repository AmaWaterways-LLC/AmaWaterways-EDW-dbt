  description: 'The sp_req_code model represents standardized service provider request
    codes  from multiple systems, including SW1 and SW2. Data from these systems may  differ
    due to varying data entry practices or system-specific nuances. This  model is
    used downstream to provide a unified view of service provider  request codes,
    enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability. Key  analytical use cases
    include analyzing request code usage, tracking changes  to request codes over
    time, and identifying discrepancies between systems.
