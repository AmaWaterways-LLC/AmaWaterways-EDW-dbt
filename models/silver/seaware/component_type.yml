    description: >
      The component_type model represents a standardized view of component types across multiple systems, 
      including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to provide a unified understanding of component types, 
      enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability. The data from multiple systems may differ 
      due to variations in data formatting, encoding, or business rules. This model is used downstream 
      to support analytics and decision-making.

    columns:
      - name: COMPONENT_TYPE_SURROGATE_KEY
        description: >
          A unique identifier for each component type, generated by combining the COMPONENT_TYPE and 
          DATA_SOURCE columns. This key ensures row uniqueness and facilitates data integration.

      - name: DATA_SOURCE
        description: >
          The source system from which the component type data originates, either SW1 or SW2. This 
          column is used to track data provenance and manage data integration.
