- name: port
  description: 'The port model represents a standardized view of ports across multiple
    source systems, including SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems may differ due
    to variations in data collection, processing, and storage.  This model is used
    downstream to provide a unified understanding of ports, enabling accurate reporting,
    metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases include analyzing port activity,
    tracking changes to port information, and identifying data discrepancies between
    source systems.
