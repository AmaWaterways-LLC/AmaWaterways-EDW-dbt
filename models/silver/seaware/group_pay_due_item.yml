  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of payment due items for
    groups across multiple systems.  The data from multiple systems may differ due
    to varying data entry practices or system-specific nuances.  This model is used
    downstream for reporting, metrics, and auditability purposes, providing a unified
    view of group payment due items.  Key analytical use cases include tracking payment
    due dates, amounts, and activity types.
