  description: 'The sail_header model represents a unified view of sail header data
    from multiple systems,  including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to standardize
    sail header data and provide a  single source of truth for downstream analytics
    and reporting. The data from multiple  systems may differ due to differences in
    data collection and processing methods. This  model is critical for reporting,
    metrics, and auditability.
