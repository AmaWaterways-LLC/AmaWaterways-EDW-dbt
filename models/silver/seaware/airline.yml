  description: 'The airline model represents a standardized view of airline data from
    multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems may differ due
    to variations in data collection and processing methods.  This model is used downstream
    to provide a unified view of airline data for reporting, analytics, and auditability.  Key
    analytical use cases include tracking airline performance, monitoring changes
    to airline data, and ensuring data consistency across systems.
