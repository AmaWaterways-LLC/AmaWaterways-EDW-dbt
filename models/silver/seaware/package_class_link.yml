  description: 'The package_class_link model represents the relationship between packages
    and their corresponding class types and codes.  This model is used to standardize
    data from multiple systems, SW1 and SW2, which may have different data structures
    and formatting.  Downstream, this model is used for reporting and analytics, providing
    insights into package classification and utilization.  Key analytical use cases
    include tracking package class changes over time and analyzing package class distributions.
