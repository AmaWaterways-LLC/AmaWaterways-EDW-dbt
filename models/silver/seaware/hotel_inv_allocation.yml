  description: 'The hotel_inv_allocation model represents the allocation of hotel
    inventory across different systems. This model is crucial for analytics and reporting,
    as it provides a standardized view of hotel inventory allocation, allowing for
    accurate tracking and management of hotel room allocations. The data from multiple
    systems may differ due to varying update frequencies, data formats, and system-specific
    nuances. This model is used downstream to generate reports on hotel inventory
    utilization, allocation trends, and optimization opportunities.
