  description: 'The insurance_type model represents a standardized view of insurance
    types across multiple source systems,  including SW1 and SW2. This model is used
    to consolidate and harmonize insurance type data,  enabling accurate reporting,
    analytics, and auditability.  Data from multiple systems may differ due to variations
    in data formatting,  collection methods, or update frequencies.  This model is
    used downstream to support business intelligence, data science, and regulatory
    compliance.
