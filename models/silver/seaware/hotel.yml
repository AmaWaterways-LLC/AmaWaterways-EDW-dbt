    description: >
      The hotel model represents a standardized view of hotel data from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2. 
      Data from these systems may differ due to variations in data collection, processing, or timing. 
      This model is used downstream for reporting, analytics, and data science applications, providing a unified understanding of hotel information. 
      Key analytical use cases include hotel performance metrics, customer preference analysis, and market trend evaluation.
