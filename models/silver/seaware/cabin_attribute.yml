  description: 'The cabin_attribute model represents standardized attributes of cabins
    across multiple systems,  providing a unified view for analytics and reporting.
    Data from different systems may differ due  to variations in data collection and
    processing methods. This model is used downstream to analyze  cabin attributes,
    track changes, and ensure data consistency. Key analytical use cases include  reporting
    on cabin attribute distributions, identifying data discrepancies, and auditing
    data quality.
