- name: sail_activity
  description: 'This model represents sail activity data from multiple sources, including
    SW1 and SW2. The data may differ between systems due to variations in data collection
    and processing. This standardized model is used downstream for reporting, metrics,
    and auditability, providing a unified view of sail activity across different sources.
    Key analytical use cases include analyzing sail activity trends, identifying discrepancies
    between sources, and tracking changes in sail activity over time.
