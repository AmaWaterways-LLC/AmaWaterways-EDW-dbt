models:
- name: vcs_domain_list_value
  description: 'This model represents a standardized list of domain values from multiple
    source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ due to differences
    in data entry, processing, or timing.  This model is used downstream to provide
    a unified view of domain values for reporting, metrics, and auditability.  Key
    analytical use cases include tracking changes in domain values over time and identifying
    discrepancies between source systems.

  - name: SOURCE_DELETED
    description: A flag indicating whether the domain value has been deleted in the
      source system.  This column is used to track the status of the domain value
      in the source system.
