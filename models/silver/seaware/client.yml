      The client model represents a unified view of customer data from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2. 
      Data from these systems may differ due to variations in data collection, processing, and storage practices. 
      This standardized model is used downstream for reporting, analytics, and auditing purposes, providing a single source of truth for customer information.
