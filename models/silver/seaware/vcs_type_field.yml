  - name: vcs_type_field
    description: >
      This model represents a standardized view of type fields from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2. 
      The data from these systems may differ due to variations in data entry, formatting, or system-specific nuances. 
      This model is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of type fields, facilitating reporting, metrics, and auditability. 
      Key analytical use cases include analyzing field usage, data quality, and system integration effectiveness.
