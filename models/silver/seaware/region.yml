  description: 'The region model represents a standardized view of geographic regions
    across multiple source systems, including SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems
    may differ due to variations in data entry, update frequencies, or system-specific
    nuances.  This model is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of
    regions, enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical
    use cases include analyzing regional trends, tracking changes in region attributes,
    and ensuring data consistency across systems.
