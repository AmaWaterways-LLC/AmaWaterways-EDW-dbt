  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of payment schedule requests
    from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ
    due to differences in data entry, processing, or system-specific nuances.  This
    model is used downstream for reporting, analytics, and auditability purposes,
    providing a unified view of payment schedules.  Key analytical use cases include
    tracking payment schedules, monitoring due dates and expiration dates, and analyzing
    payment amounts.
