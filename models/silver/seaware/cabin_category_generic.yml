- name: cabin_category_generic
  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of cabin category generic
    data from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may
    differ due to variations in data entry, formatting, or update frequencies.  This
    model is used downstream to provide a unified view of cabin category generic data
    for reporting, analytics, and auditability purposes.  Key analytical use cases
    include analyzing cabin category generic data by source system, tracking changes
    to cabin category generic data over time, and identifying discrepancies between
    source systems.
