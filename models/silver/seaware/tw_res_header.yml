  description: 'The tw_res_header model represents a standardized view of resource
    headers across multiple systems,  providing a unified understanding of resource
    allocation and utilization. Data from different systems  may differ due to variations
    in data collection and storage practices. This model is used downstream  for reporting,
    analytics, and auditability, enabling key insights into resource efficiency and
    optimization.
