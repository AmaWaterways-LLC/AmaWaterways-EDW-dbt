  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of row types across multiple
    systems,  allowing for unified analytics and reporting. Data from different systems
    may differ  due to variations in data formatting and availability. This model
    is used downstream  to provide a single source of truth for row type information,
    facilitating key  analytical use cases such as data quality reporting, data lineage
    analysis, and  auditability.
