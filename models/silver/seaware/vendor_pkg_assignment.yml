  description: 'This model represents the standardized vendor package assignment data
    from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ
    due to differences in data collection, processing, or timing.  This model is used
    downstream to provide a unified view of vendor package assignments, enabling accurate
    reporting, metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases include tracking
    vendor performance, package utilization, and service delivery metrics.
