- name: vcs_log_field
  description: 'This model represents a standardized log field from multiple source
    systems,  providing a unified view for analytics and reporting. The data from
    different  systems may differ due to variations in data formatting and collection
    methods.  This model is used downstream to generate reports, track metrics, and
    ensure  auditability across the enterprise. Key analytical use cases include log  analysis,
    data quality checks, and system performance monitoring.
