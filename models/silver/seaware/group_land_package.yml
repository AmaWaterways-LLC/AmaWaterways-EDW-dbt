  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of group land packages across
    multiple source systems,  including SW1 and SW2. The data from these systems may
    differ due to variations in data capture  and processing. This model is used downstream
    for reporting, analytics, and auditability,  providing a unified understanding
    of group land packages. Key analytical use cases include  tracking package types,
    occupancy rates, and pricing.
