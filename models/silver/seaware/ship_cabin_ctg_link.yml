- name: ship_cabin_ctg_link
  description: 'This model represents the standardized link between ship cabins and
    their respective categories,  sourced from multiple systems (SW1 and SW2). The
    data from these systems may differ due to  variations in data entry, updates,
    or system-specific nuances. This model is used downstream  for reporting, analytics,
    and auditability, providing a unified view of ship cabin categories.  Key analytical
    use cases include analyzing cabin capacity, rollaway beds, and child beds.
