- name: client_special_date
  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of client special dates
    across multiple source systems, including SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems
    may differ due to variations in data entry, processing, or timing.  This model
    is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of client special dates,
    enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases
    include analyzing client behavior, tracking special date trends, and ensuring
    data consistency across systems.
