  description: 'The gtb_doc_queue model represents a standardized view of document
    queue data from multiple systems,  including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to
    track the status of documents in the queue,  providing insights into document
    processing efficiency and identifying potential bottlenecks.  Downstream, this
    model is used for reporting, metrics, and auditability purposes.
