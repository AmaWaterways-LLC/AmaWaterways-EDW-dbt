  description: 'This model represents chargeable actions in the enterprise domain,
    combining data from multiple systems (SW1 and SW2).  The data from these systems
    may differ due to varying update frequencies, data entry practices, or system-specific
    rules.  This standardized model is used downstream for reporting, analytics, and
    auditability, providing a unified view of chargeable actions.  Key analytical
    use cases include tracking action types, payment status, and designated payment
    codes.
