  description: 'The ship model represents a standardized view of ship data from multiple
    systems, including SW1 and SW2.  Data from these systems may differ due to variations
    in data collection and storage practices.  This model is used downstream to provide
    a unified view of ship data for reporting, analytics, and auditability.  Key analytical
    use cases include tracking ship performance, capacity, and maintenance history.
