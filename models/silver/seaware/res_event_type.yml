- name: res_event_type
  description: 'This model represents a standardized view of event types from multiple
    source systems, SW1 and SW2.  The data from these systems may differ due to variations
    in data entry, formatting, or system-specific nuances.  This model is used downstream
    to provide a unified understanding of event types, enabling accurate reporting,
    metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases include analyzing event type
    distributions, tracking changes over time, and identifying discrepancies between
    source systems.
