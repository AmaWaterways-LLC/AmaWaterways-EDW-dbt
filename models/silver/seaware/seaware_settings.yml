  description: 'The seaware_settings model represents standardized application settings
    from multiple source systems, SW1 and SW2.  These settings are used to configure
    and customize the behavior of various applications across the enterprise.  Data
    from multiple systems may differ due to differences in system configuration, usage
    patterns, or data synchronization issues.  This model provides a unified view
    of these settings, enabling downstream analytics and reporting use cases such
    as auditing, compliance monitoring, and application performance analysis.
