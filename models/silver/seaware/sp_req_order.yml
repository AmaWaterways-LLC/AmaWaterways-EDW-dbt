  description: 'The sp_req_order model represents a standardized view of service request
    orders across multiple systems.  Data from different systems may differ due to
    variations in data entry, processing, or system-specific nuances.  This model
    is used downstream to provide a unified understanding of service request orders,
    enabling accurate reporting, metrics, and auditability.  Key analytical use cases
    include analyzing order volumes, tracking order status, and identifying trends
    in service requests.
