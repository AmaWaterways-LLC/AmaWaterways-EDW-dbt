  - name: suggested_land_package
    description: >
      The suggested land package model represents a standardized view of land package data from multiple source systems, including SW1 and SW2. This model is used to provide a unified understanding of land package information across the enterprise, facilitating reporting, analytics, and decision-making. The data from multiple systems may differ due to variations in data collection, processing, and storage. This model is used downstream to support key analytical use cases, such as tracking changes in land package information, analyzing trends, and identifying discrepancies between source systems.
