    description: >
      The acc_trans_type model represents a standardized view of transaction types across multiple systems, 
      including SW1 and SW2. This model is crucial for downstream analytics and reporting, as it provides a 
      unified understanding of transaction types and their corresponding attributes. The data from multiple 
      systems may differ due to varying data sources and update frequencies. This model is used to generate 
      reports on transaction types, track changes to transaction types over time, and provide auditability 
      for data changes.

    columns:
      - name: ACC_TRANS_TYPE_SURROGATE_KEY
        description: >
          A unique identifier for each transaction type, generated by combining the TRANS_TYPE and DATA_SOURCE 
          columns. This key ensures that each transaction type is uniquely represented across multiple systems.

      - name: DATA_SOURCE
        description: >
          The source system from which the transaction type data originates, either SW1 or SW2. This column 
          is used to track the origin of the data and ensure data consistency across systems.

      - name: TRANS_TYPE
        description: >
          The type of transaction, such as 'Sale' or 'Return'. This column represents the core attribute of 
          the transaction type and is used in downstream analytics and reporting.

        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: TRANS_TYPE_ID
        description: >
          A numerical identifier for the transaction type, used for reference and mapping purposes.

      - name: COMMENTS
        description: >
          Additional comments or notes related to the transaction type, providing context and clarification.

      - name: IS_GSA_COMMISSION
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the transaction type is related to a GSA commission, applicable only to SW2.

      - name: IS_STD_COMMISSION
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the transaction type is related to a standard commission, applicable only to SW2.

      - name: LAST_UPDATED_TIMESTAMP
        description: >
          The timestamp when the transaction type data was last updated, used for tracking changes and data freshness.

      - name: SOURCE_DELETED
        description: >
          A flag indicating whether the transaction type has been deleted in the source system.

      - name: TRANS_TYPE_CLASS
        description: >
          The class or category of the transaction type, applicable only to SW1.

      - name: COMMISS_TYPE
        description: >
          The commission type related to the transaction type, applicable only to SW1.

      - name: REFERENCE_CODE
        description: >
          A reference code associated with the transaction type, applicable only to SW1.
