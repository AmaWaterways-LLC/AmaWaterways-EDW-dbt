    description: >
      This model represents the standardized sail event type data from multiple systems, 
      providing a unified view for downstream analytics and reporting. The data from 
      different systems may differ due to variations in data collection and processing. 
      This model is used to generate reports, metrics, and audits, ensuring data consistency 
      and accuracy. Key analytical use cases include analyzing sail event types, 
      understanding data source differences, and tracking changes over time.
